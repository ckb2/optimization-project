output: html_document
---
### This rmd file produces the "nutritionresults.csv" output: nutrition intake by household member + day of the week + meal for a household example.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
```
Read model output "menu.csv" and data input "data_recipes.csv"
```{r,message=FALSE}

house<-read_csv("menu.csv")

recnut<-read_delim("data_recipes.csv")%>%
  rename(Recipe=recipe)

```
Merge model output recipes + serving sizes with data inputs on recipes + nutrients to produce nutrition outputs
```{r}
nutrout<-house%>%
            left_join(recnut, by="Recipe")%>%
            mutate(across(6:33, ~.x*Servings))

write_excel_csv(nutrout, "nutritionresults.csv")

```
